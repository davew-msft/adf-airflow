A basic DAG.  This also illustrates how to do local development (or at least one way to do it).  

## Usage

Start Airflow in docker using the following command:

`docker-compose up -d`

Wait for a few seconds and you should be able to access http://localhost:8080/.  Use `admin/admin` to login.  

To stop running the examples, run the following command:

`docker-compose down`
